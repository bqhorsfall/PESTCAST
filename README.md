## Why this project

> *"Which ports are most exposed right now? Where should inspectors focus their hours this season?"*

Every year, exotic fruit flies arrive at U.S. ports of entry aboard international passengers and fresh commodity shipments. USDA APHIS PPQ intercepts hundreds of specimens annually — but interception data alone lags the true introduction pressure by weeks to months.

PESTCAST is our team's answer: an end-to-end **pathway-first** pipeline that quantifies introduction risk directly from BTS air traffic, USDA commodity imports, EPPO pest presence records, and climate suitability, producing **operational 90-day risk forecasts** for all six APHIS priority fruit fly species — with a matched geospatial dashboard for presentations and a full analytical platform for resource allocation.

| Metric | PESTCAST CY2026 |
|---|---|
| **Model** | Poisson GLM, Pseudo-R² = 0.68 |
| **Validation events** | 52 APHIS detection records (CY2025, held out) |
| **Species covered** | 6 (all APHIS PPQ priority fruit fly species) |
| **Spatial resolution** | County-level establishment risk + port-of-entry pathway risk |
| **Forecast horizon** | 90-day operational window + full CY2026 outlook |
| **Validated corridors** | Mexico → TX/CA (*A. ludens*); Thailand/Kenya → West Coast (*B. dorsalis*, *C. capitata*) — consistent with APHIS 2025–2026 bulletins and IPPC phytosanitary reports |

## Six target species

| Species | Common Name |
|---|---|
| *Ceratitis capitata* | Mediterranean Fruit Fly (Medfly) |
| *Bactrocera dorsalis* | Oriental Fruit Fly |
| *Anastrepha ludens* | Mexican Fruit Fly |
| *Anastrepha suspensa* | Caribbean Fruit Fly |
| *Bactrocera zonata* | Peach Fruit Fly |
| *Rhagoletis cerasi* | European Cherry Fruit Fly |

## Two front ends

| | **Leaflet Dashboard** `app/index.html` | **PESTCAST** `app/app.py` |
|---|---|---|
| **Stack** | Static HTML + Leaflet.js + Chart.js | Streamlit + Plotly + scikit-learn |
| **Data** | Pre-built JS bundle (`app_data.js`) | Live Parquet files in `data/processed/` |
| **Species** | 3 (Medfly, Oriental FF, Mexican FF) | All 6 target species |
| **Risk model** | Deterministic composite index | Poisson GLM (Pseudo-R² = 0.68) |
| **Forecasting** | Monthly index, current year | CY2026 forecast + 90-day operational window |
| **Best for** | Quick geospatial overview, presentations | Operational analysis, resource allocation |

## How it works

At its core, PESTCAST computes a **pathway-weighted introduction risk** for each `(origin_country × dest_port × species × month)` cell, then layers a calibrated Poisson GLM to produce detection-probability forecasts and county-level establishment risk maps.

```

**Risk score formula:**

```
risk = (passengers + freight / 5,000) × pest_presence_score
```

Aggregated monthly per `(origin_country × dest_port × species)`.

Pest presence scored from EPPO distribution records: `3` = widespread · `2` = restricted · `1` = few occurrences / transient.

### Why we built it this way

- **Two complementary tools, not one.** The Leaflet dashboard is a zero-dependency presentation layer — shareable without a Python environment. The Streamlit app is the full analytical platform: Poisson GLM forecasts, marginal surveillance value, county-level establishment risk, and exportable leadership briefings.
- **Pathway-weighted, not model-predicted (Leaflet).** The static dashboard computes a deterministic composite index — volume × pest_score — producing interpretable, auditable scores. The Streamlit app layers a fitted Poisson GLM for detection-calibrated forecasts.
- **Cargo scaling.** T-100 FREIGHT is in pounds; passengers are integer headcounts. Raw freight values are ~5,000× larger. The `freight / 5,000` factor approximately equalises their contributions. The *Include Cargo Risk* toggle lets analysts compare passenger-only vs. combined pathway risk.
- **Pre-computation at build time.** `05_build_app_data.py` pre-aggregates all risk by `(species × month × country)` and `(species × month × US_port)`. The browser performs no heavy aggregation at runtime — all slider and filter updates are O(n_countries) lookups.
- **90-day operational window.** The PESTCAST app flags the next ~90 days as the operationally reliable forecast horizon. Month cells outside this window are rendered faded and labelled "outlook" to distinguish near-term actionable risk from longer-range projections.

## Dashboard features

### Leaflet Dashboard (`index.html`)

**Map layers** (all toggleable):
- Country choropleth in two modes: *Pest Presence* (EPPO score categories) or *Pathway Risk* (gradient heatmap — flight volume × pest score). Choropleth opacity encodes pathway volume so countries with the same EPPO score are visually differentiated by traffic intensity.
- Great-circle flight arcs for the top 15 / 30 / 50 risk routes, coloured and weighted by risk tier.
- U.S. port-of-entry bubbles sized by total inbound risk score; click for full origin breakdown.

**Controls:** Month slider (Jan–Dec) with play/pause animation · Species filter · Cargo toggle · Port IATA labels · Focus CONUS / World view

**Sidebar panels** (each collapsible): Risk summary stats · Top 12 risk pathways with species badges · U.S. port exposure chart · Monthly passenger flow trend · Host commodity imports by partner country · Recent detections & IPPC alerts feed · Risk model methodology callout

> No API keys are required for either dashboard. T-100 and GATS data require manual export from BTS TranStats and USDA FAS GATS portals — see [`DATA_PLAN.md`](DATA_PLAN.md) for step-by-step instructions.

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- T-100 and GATS CSV exports (see `DATA_PLAN.md` for step-by-step instructions)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bqhorsfall/PESTCAST.git
cd PESTCAST
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Leaflet dashboard (no pipeline required if `app_data.js` is present)

```bash
cd app && python3 -m http.server 8765
# open http://localhost:8765
```

### Run the PESTCAST Streamlit platform

```bash
.venv/bin/streamlit run app/app.py
# opens automatically at http://localhost:8501
```

Requires processed Parquet files in `data/processed/` — generated by the pipeline below.

---

## Reproducing the full pipeline

```bash
# 1. Check which raw data files are present
python scripts/01_acquire_data.py --check

# 2. Auto-download files that can be fetched directly (airports, country codes, GeoJSON)
python scripts/01_acquire_data.py --auto

# 3. Build the join table from all raw CSVs
python scripts/02_build_join_table.py

# 4. Fit the Poisson GLM risk model
python scripts/03_fit_risk_model.py

# 5. Compute marginal surveillance value per county
python scripts/04_marginal_value.py

# 6. Compute climate suitability by county (WorldClim + CDL)
python scripts/06_climate_suitability.py

# 7. Generate county-level risk predictions
python scripts/07_county_predict.py

# 8. Build the Leaflet app data bundle
python scripts/05_build_app_data.py
```

`05_build_app_data.py` is idempotent — re-running regenerates the bundle from whatever raw files are present. Expected runtime: ~15 seconds for the full dataset.

## Limitations & honest caveats

- **Poisson GLM, not a deep model.** Pseudo-R² of 0.68 on 52 detection events is solid for this data volume, but the model has limited capacity to capture non-linear interactions between pathway pressure and establishment suitability. A richer model would require substantially more labeled interception records.
- **Deterministic risk index (Leaflet).** The static dashboard's composite score — volume × pest_score — is interpretable and auditable, but it is not calibrated against detection frequency. Two countries with the same score can have meaningfully different real-world introduction probabilities.
- **EPPO presence scores are coarse.** The three-tier presence score (widespread / restricted / transient) collapses substantial within-country heterogeneity. Sub-national pest distribution data was not available at the required geographic resolution for all six species.
- **CDL is a single-year host mask.** The host-crop layer uses the 2025 USDA CDL clip (`cdl_2025_clipped.tif`). As an annual crop-specific raster it captures a single season's planting and does not reflect within-year or year-to-year crop rotation.
- **T-100 and GATS data require manual export.** These datasets cannot be auto-fetched programmatically due to portal limitations. The pipeline degrades gracefully if either is absent, but risk score coverage will be reduced.
- **Uncertainty is only partially quantified.** The Poisson GLM does emit 80% confidence intervals on the predicted mean (μ) — `mu_lo80`/`mu_hi80` from `03_fit_risk_model.py` — but these are (a) *frequentist* confidence intervals on the fitted mean, **not** Bayesian credible intervals, and (b) not full predictive intervals over counts (they exclude Poisson dispersion around μ). The 90-day operational window label reflects temporal reliability, not probabilistic confidence.
